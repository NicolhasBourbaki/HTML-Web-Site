            Tyler Robert Joseph (born December 1, 1988) is an American singer, rapper, musician, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman for the musical duo Twenty One Pilots, alongside bandmate Josh Dun. He has been nominated for six Grammy Awards as a member of Twenty One Pilots, of which he has won one. 
           
            
        Joseph was born in Columbus, Ohio and has two younger brothers, Zack and Jay Joseph (the latter of whom is also a musician), as well as one sister named Madison Brett. His mother, Kelly Joseph (n√©e Stryker), was a math teacher in the Olentangy school district before being named Olentangy Orange High School's basketball coach in 2013. His father, Christopher Anthony "Chris" Joseph, is of Lebanese descent and was a coach at Worthington Christian High School from 1996 to 2005, as well as being a former school principal.

            Joseph played basketball from a very young age and went on to play point guard for Worthington Christian. In 2008, the varsity basketball team placed second in the Division IV state tournament.Future Twenty One Pilots bassist Nick Thomas also played on the same team with Joseph, the pair having performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" together at one of their games.
            
            In 2007, Joseph began uploading short comedic skits and videos to a YouTube channel named "slushieguys". The channel currently has over 126 thousand subscribers as of August 2021, although the channel hasn't uploaded any content since 2013.
            
            After seeing a songwriter perform at a High Street club, he rejected an opportunity to play basketball at Otterbein University, along with a scholarship to the university. He began playing music after finding an old keyboard in his closet, a Christmas gift from his mother, and began to mimick various radio melodies. From around 2007 to 2008, Joseph recorded a solo album titled "No Phun Intended" in his basement. It was later revealed that Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the album.
            
            Among Joseph's first performances with Twenty One Pilots, he recounts that his mother would often stand outside of Ohio State University giving away tickets to his shows. "She'd be like, 'Come see my son play music'", Joseph says.
